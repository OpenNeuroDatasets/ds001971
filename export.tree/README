 This mobile brain body imaging (MoBI) gait adaptation experiment contains 18 subjects. 
Participants were walking on a treadmill at a constant speed and were required to step in 
time to an auditory tone sequence and adapt their step length and rate to occasional
shifts in tempo of the pacing stimulus (i.e., following shifts to a faster or slower tempo).
